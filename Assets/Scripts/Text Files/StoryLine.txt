Levels/Maps

Strait of Hormuz - Vital oil route containing a narrow chokepoint connecting the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. Pirates stalk these waters. 

Taiwan Strait - a highly contested waterway 110 miles wide in the South China Sea. Military patrols and unfriendly coast guard and fisherman are a common sight in these waters. 

Northern Sea Route - polar shipping route along the Arctic coast of Russia. Ice bergs and whales can be surprisingly dangerous in these waters.
